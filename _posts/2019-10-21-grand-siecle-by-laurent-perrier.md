<h1 class="sp_offer">Grand Siècle by Laurent-Perrier</h1>
Recreating the perfect year

The idea of Grand Siècle was born from a simple observation: that nature would never provide the perfect oenological year, but that thanks to the art of assemblage, Laurent-Perrier could in fact create it.

Going well beyond rare vintages, Grand Siècle is created choosing not one but three exceptional years which complement each other perfectly. We must then wait for at least 8 years of ageing in our cellars before it can be enjoyed.

The pinnacle of the art of blending, Grand Siècle is the unique expression of the pursuit of excellence in Champagne; it is to ‘blend the best with the best to obtain the best.’

Join us in November 2019 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Laurent-Perrier Grand Siècle and receive a complimentary glass of this stunning Champagne before dinner in our candlelit restaurant.
