In 2003 we undertook our journey to find the perfect property to develop in to a our dream hotel. We travelled the world, exploring and researching some beautiful locations and stunning settings.

Our journey began from home in North Yorkshire, in the North East of England. We had not been able to find the right property there, so we started to look further afield, travelling to Italy, the South of France, Spain, Marrakesh and beyond.

One cold and dreary Sunday morning in November, 2005, browsing on the internet at home in Yorkshire, a bright and cheery online image caught our eye. There was a property for sale, in the idyllic little village of Bainbridge, Wensleydale. It was right on our doorstep, having searched for so long.

It took eighteen months of rebuilding and converting the Headmasterâ€™s House and old Grammar School, into a restaurant with rooms.

It is now an AA 5 star highly commended Restaurant with Rooms, and the only 3 Rosette Restaurant with an AA UK Breakfast Award in the Dales.

<div class="tdesc">

Dan Shotton joined Yorebridge House as Head Chef in August 2013. Since his arrival, the restaurant has gone from strength to strength, winning awards and titles, such as the coveted 3AA Rosettes in 2014. In addition, we have won Restaurant of the Year in 2014 from Flavours of Herriot and Welcome to Yorkshire.

Dan started his catering career studying at his local College in Darlington, where he obtained professional qualifications in patisserie and cooking. After completing his studies his career took him overseas to Amsterdam, working at esteemed establishments such as The Grand Hotel which was 5* deluxe, Cafe Roux.

Moving back to the UK in 2005, Dan has worked for respected chefs at hotels such as the Lacemarket Hotel in Nottingham, under Head Chef Patrick Tweedie, and Kenny Atkinson at Rockliffe Hall in County Durham. In 2012 Dan achieved his first 3AA Rosette, having succeeded Kenny Atkinson in the role.

Raised in Yorkshire, Dan knows the area well and uses this to his advantage in the kitchen. He is passionate about local produce which is reflected in his ideas. The seasonal menus he creates compliment the character and attributes of the hotel, and portray his passion for fine dining, producing dishes that excel in design, flavour and innovation.
